# Tic Tac Toe Game Prasidh Bhardwaj
 This is a Tic Tac Toe Game built by Prasidh Bhardwaj using C++ language. I did not use pointers for this small project but used loops and 2D arrays. I faced a lot of problems while building this. Several small issues were pertaining but I did not succumb to those & without referring to any video tutorial, fixed them by myself. I will elaborate on what type of mistakes I was making & what I learnt from them during this project. Please tell what improvements can be done on this.
